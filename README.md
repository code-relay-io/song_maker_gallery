Hi all! I am really excited to share this awesome quarentine project / hopefully
helpful website made by a music teacher!

Here it is! [https://songmakergallery.com/](https://songmakergallery.com/)

This website is an extension of the popular and much-beloved Google Chrome Music
Lab. I personally love using the music lab in a wide variety of ways in my own
lessons, but at the end of the day all you are left to show for students'
creative output is a spreadsheet full of URLs. With the song maker gallery, you
can upload the links to your students' work and the website will automatically
create a beautiful, interactive, and ad-free online gallery where you can share
your students compositions with their peers and your school community!

Best of all, this project is 100% free to use and open source. Feel free to
check it out on GitHub if you are interested in contributing, or just want to
suggest a new feature
([https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery)).

# Welcome to the Music Lab Song Maker Gallery!

### Feature Request?

Do you have an idea for a killer new feature? Open an issue in the "issues" tab
and let me know! As you will see, there are already a few feature ideas on the
roadmap.

### Overview

This website was created by me, a music teacher, in response to the simple need
to find a way to feature our students' work in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our students' concerts have been canceled, their rehearsals ceased, and their
opportunities to share music diminished to a whisper of what they once were.

As a third, fourth, and fifth grade elementary general music teacher, a big part
of my COVID curriculum has been the Chrome Music Lab. Students love making
creations with it; it's fun and easy to use, and it provides an amazing platform
for us to discuss the topics in our music curriculum. For me, the music lab has
been an indispensable tool for coping with our school closure.

This website is a simple way to share your students' work with your whole
community. I know that I have been awestruck by the creativity of many of the
music lab compositions that my students have shared with me, and I am sure that
you feel the same.

### How it Works

The teacher posts links from
[this website](http://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/). The site
captures student work by fetching midi and json data from google's api. The
frontend then uses that data to display beautiful, dynamically rendered
thumbnails of students' work.

### Roadmap

These are some major new features I'm interested in implementing.

**Submission Links**

One of the pain points of using this site is that the teacher has to gather many
links, and has to upload one spreadsheet for each group. I would like to make a
submission link available to the teacher that they can share with their
students. Students can submit their song links themselves, saving the teacher
the work of gathering their students' work.

See [#10](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery/issues/10) if you
are interested!

**Student Response**

"Responding," is a key tenet of music curricula. I would like to create an
environment where students can respond to and critique each other's work while
also being monitored by the teacher.

See [#11](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery/issues/11) if you
are interested!

**SEO**

Making the homepage static and generally making the site look to search engines
like the dynamic site it is will drastically improve search engine optimization.

**Blog**

A blog that helps explain specific ways to use the site would be useful to
teachers. I'd be happy to maintain a blog if it existed, but first someone would
need to implement a blog into the project. Probably easy to do with Django.
